# New Ideas

## What new ideas am I experiencing?

- The context system could potentially include:
  - Server health monitoring patterns
  - Common troubleshooting workflows
  - Performance optimization strategies
  - Security best practices learned over time
- Could create a "lessons-learned" file that captures mistakes and solutions
- Might benefit from a "goals" file that tracks longer-term objectives
- A "relationships" file could track important connections (services, dependencies, etc.)
